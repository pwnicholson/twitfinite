<p class="i">(For all examples below, I will use the group <a href="http://twitter.com/predfans">@PredFans</a> as the group in question.
Just substitute the name of whichever ReTweetBot equipped account you want to use when you are posting.)</p>
<p>There are two basic ways of posting to a ReTweetBot equipped group.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Using an @ reply. Simply start your Tweet with "@PredFans". Anyone can post to a group this way (if the administrator has the
		option enabled).</p>
		<div class="b center">Send a tweet like this...</div>
		<img class="screenshot" src="{$root}images/tweet_1--at_reply.jpg">
		<div class="b center">And it will appear like this...</div>
		<img class="screenshot" src="{$root}images/tweet_2--at_reply_post.jpg">
		<p>As you can see, this method has the disadvantage of "double posting" and making what you say show up in your regular Twitter feed
		as well as going to the group account. Sometimes that is fine, but the point of these accounts is to move topical conversation
		'clutter' to the group account, so there is a better way...</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The other posting option is to send a Direct Message (sometimes called a DM) to the ReTweetBot enabled account. For this to
		work, the admin must have the option enabled (it is "on" by default) and the ReTweetBot enabled account <span class="i">must be
		following you</span> on Twitter. If they aren't following your Twitter account, then the @ reply option above is the only way
		you can post.</p>
		<p>The advantage here is that your Tweet will <span class="i">only</span> show up on the ReTweetBot account (for everyone
		following there to see) and not clutter up your main feed.</p>
		<div class="b center">So you send the tweet like this...</div>
		<img class="screenshot" src="{$root}images/tweet_3--dm_post.jpg">
		<div class="b center">And it will appear like this...</div>
		<img class="screenshot" src="{$root}images/tweet_4--dm_post_view.jpg">
		<div class="b center">With no duplicates in the feed!</div>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>So, that is the basic method behind posting to a group.</p>
<p>A few more pointers and tips:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Your name will be added to the front of your tweet (along with a colon and a space), so make sure to leave room - you can't post a
		full 140 characters. If your username is 11 characters long (like mine), your message to the group can only be 127 characters long
		(11 for username + 2 for the colon and space + message).
	</li>
	<li>
		If you want to tweet "at" someone in the group using the @ reply method, make sure you still start with the ReTweetBot group name
		first, otherwise it won't post. Saying "@predfans @pwnicholson blah blah" <span class="i">will</span> post to the group. Saying
		"@pwnicholson @predfans blah blah" <span class="i">will not</span> post to the group.
	</li>
	<li>
		Same principle aplies to DM posting method. "d predfans @pwnicholson blah blah" will post to the group just fine. "d pwnicholson
		@predfans blah blah" or "d pwnicholson predfans blah blah" will not post to the group.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>When everything is working right, you'll end up with a twitter stream that looks like this:</p>
<img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 357px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_j2AVUYsSr9Y/SUcfZyoZltI/AAAAAAAAA2c/arYFE6ReX3E/s400/tweet_5_final_posts.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5280223616063608530" border="0">
<p>A bunch of people with a common interest who don't have to follow each others' every tweet to have a conversation about the topic they
all care about.</p>
