Thank you for downloading the Round and Round theme for WordPress!

If you'd rather change this theme to work fit in 800x600 browsers, it's easy - just follow the directions in the Stylesheet file.

Any repeating vertical background image will work with this theme.  
To change the background image, simply upload the image you'd like to use to the images directory of the theme.
Then, find this piece of CSS near the top of the Stylesheet file:
body{
	background-image:  url(images/background.gif);

and change 'background.gif' to the name of the image file you'd like to use.  My recommendation is not to use one
that is too wide if it is very dark, as the transparency effect will cause the text in your posts to be difficult to read.

Thanks again, and please pay me a visit at http://randaclay.com and let me know how you're using the theme. 
I'd like to check out your site!
